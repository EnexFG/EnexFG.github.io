<p align="justify"> <b>Abstract.</b> We revisit the fiscal return to public investment using a present-value self-financing criterion that can be interpreted as a benchmark decision rule for a revenue-constrained government in oil-exporting economies. We first derive simple analytical bounds that translate the condition into requirements on discounted multipliers, clarifying why a multiplier greater than one is necessary but far from sufficient for self-financing. We then implement the test for Ecuador—an oil-exporting, dollarized economy—using a Bayesian VAR with sign and zero restrictions over 2004Q1–2019Q3. The empirical framework treats oil revenues as a fiscal income component and assesses the relevance of oil-revenue exogeneity in a resource-dependent setting. We evaluate five specifications: public-investment and public-consumption shocks, an oil-revenue shock, and two financing-based scenarios (deficit-financed and oil-financed investment). Across horizons up to 80 quarters, median present-value ratios lie well below the self-financing threshold. The most favorable case—deficit-financed investment—approaches unity but remains far short of the threshold, while oil-financed investment performs noticeably worse. We conclude that, although public investment raises output, it does not generate present-value fiscal returns commensurate with its cost. </p>
