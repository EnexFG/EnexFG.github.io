I am an applied econometrician with experience in academia, industry, and public policy. Currently, I serve as Chief Economist at Andersen Ecuador and Associate Professor at ESPOL and Ecotec. I have advised leading public and private institutions in Ecuador, and I have also served in policymaking roles. My research interests include applied macroeconometrics, Bayesian methods, forecasting, and natural language processing. I am also active in public commentary, contributing regularly to the fiscal policy debate and economic analysis in Ecuador.
